<p>Beginning in the 1930, Moscow kept Turkmenistan under its control. In 1988, many of the republics that made up the Soviet Union began to criticize Moscow's economic policies. After the 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Mosocow, Turkmenistan's communist leader, Saparmyrat Niyazov, called for a popular referendum on independence. The offical result of the referendum was 94 percent in favor of independence. The republic's Supremem Soviet leaders had little choice other than to declare Turkmenistan's independence from the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Republic of Turkmenistan on October 27, 1991.</p>
<p>The Monument of Independence is the highest monument structure in the country. The monument is 118 meters tall, which is a derivative of the day and year of its independence(27+91). The lower part of the monument presents a hemisphere, resembling the form of traditional Turkmen yuta. The top part of the monument is a tall steeple toped with a crown with five stars- a symbol of unification of the five largest Turkmen tribes.</p>

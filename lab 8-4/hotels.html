<h1>Ashgabat</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p>Ashgabat is not only a largest city and capital of Turkmenistan, but also is cultural, financial and transportation hub. Modern buildings mingle with historic properties, imposing government buildings and the country's largest libraries and museums. There are many elegant hotels throughout the city. All the hotels, as mos of the public buildings, are covered with a beautiful white marble giving the ciry a futuristic look</p>
<p>Ashgabat has dozens of highclass hotels, including fashionable "President Hotel" opened a year ago. The well proportioned silhouette of the 17 storeyed magigicent building sparkling with stain glass windows and glaringly white marble has become inseparable part of the urban lanscape of Ashgabt's new buisness center rapidly growing in Kopetdag foothills. For the short time, the hotel managed to win the title of the best one in Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>The Nissa Hotel was built in 1996. It is located in the city center and near Independence Monument, the Residnece of the President of Turkmenistan, congress and Arts Palace. It is considered one of the finest in the country.</p>
